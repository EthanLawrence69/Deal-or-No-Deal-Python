# Deal-or-No-Deal-Python
The famous TV series deal or no deal, but made in python using a rms algorithm to work out the dealers offers.
the boxes are kept secret and randomised with the value they hold
each round you guess which box you want to open and the price pool becomes smaller 
every few rounds the dealer will make an offer based on an rms algorithm
I used tkinter for basic GUI
